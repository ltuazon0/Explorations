# Log
This section documents all insights&mdash;technical aspects, personal musings, or otherwise&mdash;
gained throughout each iteration & exploration of the projects enclosed. While this log is first & 
foremost for my own personal growth & development, enumerating the bits of knowledge I've gained in 
a public space offers not only just insight into me & the way I process & work through things to 
prospective employers but its open accessibility may also help others on (_dis_)similar paths. Entries 
are meant to be brief & concise with _succinctness_ being the operative word (or so I pray it will be). 
If I find something to be particularly insightful, a link directing to my own personal thoughts on the 
matter will be included.
